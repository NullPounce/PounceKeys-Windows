# PounceKeys-Windows
 Keyloggers for windows, currently this is a python script that allows you to insert your Gmail and App passord "and edit the buffer" to build a exe that runs on startup and in the background creating no logs fully FUD undedected by Windows live/cloud protection.

 as of right now I have not shared the python FUD Gmail keylogger, I will share a
 java version that logs to a local text file for now.
